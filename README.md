# Torch Optimizer Visualizations

### PyTorch Optimizer Visualization.

This is a simple PyTorch project that provides a
visualization tool for common optimization algorithms
used in deep learning. The goal is to help users gain
a better understanding of how these algorithms work 
and how they affect the optimization process.

### Usage

### Supported Optimizers

The following optimizers are currently supported:

| Optimizer | Link |
|-----------|------|
| Adam      | [https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) |
